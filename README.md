🛡️ Satya-Check
AI-Powered WhatsApp Scam & Local Truth Intelligence Engine for Bharat

Built for Amazon AI for Bharat Hackathon

🚨 Problem Statement

In India, misinformation and scams spread rapidly through forwarded WhatsApp messages — especially in regional languages.

Common examples:

“Free Jio recharge – click now”

“RBI banned ₹2000 notes – exchange immediately”

Fake subsidy schemes

OTP/KYC phishing scams

Deepfake political or health videos

Victims are often:

Elderly users

First-time smartphone users

Non-English speakers

Users in Tier 2/3 cities

There is no automatic, multilingual, region-aware protection layer.

💡 Our Solution

Satya-Check is an AI-powered scam and misinformation detection engine that:

Automatically scans forwarded messages

Detects scam patterns in text, images, and links

Cross-verifies claims with local truth sources

Generates a scam probability score (0–100%)

Provides clear, actionable warnings

It requires no manual input from the user.

📍 2. Local Truth Intelligence Layer (Key Innovation)
